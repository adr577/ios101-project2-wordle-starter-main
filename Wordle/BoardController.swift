    // Exercise 5 Pt. 2 (optional): This function only needs to be implemented if you decide to do the optional requirement (see Pt. 1 in ViewController.swift)

    // Tip 3: Assign the correct value of the setting to the `numItemsPerRow` property.
    // Tip 4: You will need to cast the value to the correct type

    // Tip 3: Assign the correct value of the setting to the `numRows` property.

    // Exercise 3: Implement applyThemeSettings to change the goal word according to the theme
    // Tip 1: There is a constant `kWordThemeKey` in Constants.swift that you can use as the key to grab the theme as a String in the dictionary
    // Tip 2: Pass-in the theme to `WordGenerator.generateGoalWord` (see WordGenerator.swift) and assign its result to the `goalWord` defined above
    //  - The value stored in the settings dictionary is a String, but `WordGenerator.generateGoalWord` expects a WordTheme type.
    //    Use the `WordTheme(rawValue:)` initializer to pass-in the string from the dictionary to get the correct type
    // Checkpoint: Correctly implementing this should allow you to change the theme of the goal word! Use breakpoints or print statements
    // to check the before/after value of goalWord and see if it changes to the correct theme

  // Exercise 4: Implement applyIsAlienWordleSettings to change the goal word after each guess
  // Tip 1: There is a constant `kIsAlienWordleKey` in Constants.swift that you can use as the key to grab the value in the dictionary
  // Tip 2: There is a corresponding property located in this file that you should assign the value of the setting to (look at the "Properties" section above).
  // Checkpoint: Correctly implementing this function should change the goal word each time the user inputs an entire row of letters
  private func applyIsAlienWordleSettings(with settings: [String: Any]) {
